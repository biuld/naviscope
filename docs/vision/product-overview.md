# Product Overview

## Positioning
Naviscope is a unified code knowledge graph engine that serves both AI agents and developer tools with the same structural understanding of a codebase. It sits between language-specific parsers and user-facing interfaces, providing consistent semantics and fast queries.

## Core Value
- One graph shared by CLI, LSP, and MCP
- Fast startup with incremental enrichment
- Stable identifiers for long-lived references
- External dependency understanding without blocking indexing

## Target Users
- Developers who need reliable navigation and dependency analysis
- AI agents that require structured, precise context for reasoning

## Key Scenarios
- Search and inspect symbols across a large codebase
- Understand type hierarchies and relationships quickly
- Navigate external dependencies with stubs and on-demand sources

## Differentiation
- Graph-first model instead of text-only search
- Background stubbing for external assets
- Shared caches across projects to reduce cold start cost
